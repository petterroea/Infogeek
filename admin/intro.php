Hi, and welcome to infogeek!<br />
This is a infoscreen system aimed for computer parties, that is backed by a simple CMS.<br />
While the goal is to have a system for relaying information on a screen, we have allways tried to make it as customizable as possible.<br />
<br />
Therefore, the following features are in development:<br />
<ul>
	<li>CSS customisation</li>
	<li>Plugin support</li>
</ul>
Good luck with your project, and we hope you will like infogeek!<br />
