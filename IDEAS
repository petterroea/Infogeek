TODO FOR 1.1 RELEASE:
1. Working user system
2. Working plugin system
3. Working conf page.

*Currently, only admin accounts are supported. For other accounts, mabe add some system with another table where slides are stored until they are accepted?
	Fix: Create seperate tables where revisions are stored. Only one can stay there at a time, and if the slide is deleted, so is the revision
	Target: 1.2
